<h1 align="center" style="color:#777;"> ðŸ”‘ Random Password Generator </h1>


## :memo: Description

I developed a random password generator. This application generates two random 15-character passwords containing letters, numbers and symbols when the *Generate password* button is clicked. In order to use the desired password easily, when the *Copy* buttons under the passwords are pressed, the desired password is copied to the clipboard. So never use an insecure password again.


I used Figma file to planning and I designed it according to the desired dimensions. You can test this project by following [this link](https://ebrar-password-generator.netlify.app/).
  
### :dart: What I've Aimed to Learned?

- **_For loop_**
- **_Math.random()_** method
- **_Math.floor()_** method
- Copy something to the clipboard by **_navigator.clipboard_**.
